# Getting Started with Create React App
 
## About this app

This app was developed 1 year ago. Initially I used PHP to host the news, but I recently moved it to an ARRAY in JavaScript. This project is free to use, mainly for UI design inspirations.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies used in the project, which are necessary to make it work.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
